### CREAM
## continuous recording, easy access to media

CREAM uses the turbo.lua framework for its asynchronous
system event and http handling capabilities.


The purpose of this project is to provide a "remote recording and media-serving" platform which can be used to trigger recording of audio from any attached USB microphones, and serve these recordings over an easy to use web interface.
